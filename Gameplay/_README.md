# Gameplay Props #

Props are specific, functional objects which are
found in other entities and physics objects

Props should be holistic in their system implementation, 
meaning that adding a prop to any scene should be viable

Props can have library files, which define common behaviors -
for example, if weapon props have virtually the same base shooting logic
and their functionality can be abstracted away to a custom node

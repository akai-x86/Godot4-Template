# Common Files #

Common files are defined as any and 
all files which are reused among `Stages` 
and other props.

Those can include:
- Prototyping textures
- Detail assets like rocks, barrels etc.
- Common gameplay elements, 
such as coins, health packs, ammo crates

The implication of the Common files, is that
they're basically *nothing* without the Stages
